# SpotifyPlaylistCurator

Small project to create Playlists on Spotify based on the user current's playlist.

Current version: Only allows for user to input duration of playlist and select exist the current playlist to base the new playlist on.

Future improvements:
- Allow playlist "intervals"
  - e.g. 10 mins slow music 20 mins upbeat 5 mins chill just instrumental.
  
 - Look at user library and not just current playlists
